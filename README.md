<h1 align="center">PyTurk</h1>
PyTurk is a minimal deep learning framework built on top of a micrograd-style autodiff engine. It focuses on learning, clarity and internal mechanics rather than speed or production features.

Architectures like MLPs, Transformers, and Residual networks are implemented to visualize and understand:

1. gradient flow
2. exploding & vanishing phenomena
3. normalization & stabilization strategies
4. optimizer behaviors
5. loss curvature and training dynamics

It’s a learning-first framework, not a performance clone of PyTorch.
